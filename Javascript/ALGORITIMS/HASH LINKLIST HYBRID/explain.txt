say you have a grid of objects and thoughs objects knew about their surrounding objects.

- linking objects via pointers in the grid would be a way of connecting the objects.

Taking that into account if you wanted to find an object you would have to travese the grid which is slow.

which a hashtable indexing objects which point to their neighbours, it will be fast at finding nodes as well as traversing.

heuristics

make this in c btw , with random data.
